TO DO LIST:
-----------

26/11/2010 TO DO:
  fitted.GLMM_MCMC not yet implemented for situations when there are only fixed effects in the model

14/06/2010 TO DO:
  In GLMM_Deviance.cpp
       Commands:  *marg_ll_iP += *w_k * AK_Basic::exp0_AK(loglik_k);  (around line 239)
                  *marg_ll_iP = AK_Basic::log0_AK(*marg_ll_iP); (around line 252)
       In the case of the poisson response, it would be desirable to add log(y!) to loglik_k before exp-it    
       and subtract it again after log the mixture sum. With higher counts, loglik_k is quite considerably negative
       which leads to exp(-Inf) = 0 and then upon log again, we get -Inf log-likelihood where
       -Inf is artificial due to imprecise calculation with numbers close to zero.

  --> more or less solved on 03/12/2010

======================================================================================================================

01/05/2012:
All pdf vignettes moved to my personal webpage (to decrease the size of the package which must be stored on CRAN)

18/12/2011:
GLMM_MCMC creates by default two parallel chains and calculates also PED, support for parallel computation 
on multicore CPUs using snow package added

20/01/2011:
beta in GLMM_MCMC function (and all related) was renamed to alpha to be in agreement with papers

29/11/2010:
calculation of posterior quantiles for estimated component probabilities added to NMixRelabel functions
(both NMixMCMC and GLMM_MCMC version)

08/12/2009
bug in computation of weights for the EB estimate of random effects in GLMM_longitPred_nmix_gauss.cpp fixed

22/11/2009
function NMixClust renamed to NMixPlugDA

06/11/2009
bugs in GLMM_updateRanEf.cpp found and fixed:  
  * eta_random was computed incorrectly as Z %*% bscaled and not as Z %*% b, where b = shift + diag(scale) %*% b
  * pointers in the final part of the code did not shift correctly
