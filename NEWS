TO DO LIST:
-----------

26/11/2010 TO DO:
  fitted.GLMM_MCMC not yet implemented for situations when there are only fixed effects in the model

14/06/2010 TO DO:
  In GLMM_Deviance.cpp
       Commands:  *marg_ll_iP += *w_k * AK_Basic::exp0_AK(loglik_k);  (around line 239)
                  *marg_ll_iP = AK_Basic::log0_AK(*marg_ll_iP); (around line 252)
       In the case of the poisson response, it would be desirable to add log(y!) to loglik_k before exp-it    
       and subtract it again after log the mixture sum. With higher counts, loglik_k is quite considerably negative
       which leads to exp(-Inf) = 0 and then upon log again, we get -Inf log-likelihood where
       -Inf is artificial due to imprecise calculation with numbers close to zero.

31/01/2020 (version 5.2):
Minor changes to make the -Wunused-value option of the CRAN check happy,
mainly for(s; STATEMENT1; STATEMENT2) changed to for(; STATEMENT1; STATEMENT2), two real bugs
(not shifted pointers in GLMM_updateRanEf.cpp:626:6, NMix_updateMeansVars.cpp:516:9) also corrected.

Formal correction of some header files (e-mail B. Ripley from 18/09/2016).

02/06/2016 (version 4.3):
Argument type added to cbplot function.

01/08/2015 (version 4.2):
Bug in getProfiles corrected that was incidentally created in version 4.1.

28/07/2015 (version 4.1):

Bug in GLMM_MCMCdata corrected (it appeared when two or more discrete responses
of the same type, e.g., binomial, were included in the model).

CITATION file updated (methodological papers removed from there).

21/08/2014 (version 3.7):
NMixCluster function added (currently only method for class GLMM_MCMC).

conflicts with rWishart in package stats.

01/05/2012:

  * eta_random was computed incorrectly as Z %*% bscaled and not as Z %*% b, where b = shift + diag(scale) %*% b
  * pointers in the final part of the code did not shift correctly
