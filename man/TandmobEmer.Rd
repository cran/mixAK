\title{Signal Tandmobiel data - emergence times}
\description{
  This is a part of the \code{\link{Tandmob}} data containing only
  emergence times and some baseline covariates. Here, all left-censored
  emergence times have been changed into interval-censored with the
  lower limit of the intervals equal to 5 years of age (clinically
  minimal time before which the permanent teeth hardly emerge). Also
  censoring indicators are added to be able to use the data directly
  with the \code{\link{NMixMCMC}} function.
