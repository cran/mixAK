\arguments{
  \item{y}{vector, matrix or data frame with responses. If \code{y} is vector then
     there is only one response in the model. If \code{y} is matrix or data frame then
     each column gives values of one response. Missing values are allowed.

     If there are several responses specified then 
     continuous responses must be put in the first columns and
     discrete responses in the subsequent columns.
  }
  \item{dist}{character (vector) which determines distribution (and a link function)
     for each response variable. Possible values are:
     \dQuote{gaussian} for gaussian (normal) distribution (with identity link),
     \dQuote{binomial(logit)} for binomial (0/1) distribution with a logit link.
     \dQuote{poisson(log)} for Poisson distribution with a log link.     
     Single value is recycled if necessary.
  }
  \item{id}{vector which determines longitudinally or otherwise dependent observations. If not given then it is assumed
    that there are no clusters and all observations of one response are
    independent.
  }
  \item{x}{matrix or a list of matrices with covariates (intercept not included) for fixed effects.
    If there is more than one response, this must always be a list. Note that intercept in included
    in all models. Use a character value \dQuote{empty} as a component of the list \code{x}
    if there are no covariates for a particular response.
  }
  \item{z}{matrix or a list of matrices with covariates (intercept not included) for random effects.
    If there is more than one response, this must always be a list. Note that random intercept
    is specified using the argument \code{random.intercept}.

    REMARK: For a particular response, matrices \code{x} and \code{z}
    may not have the same columns. That is, matrix \code{x} includes
    covariates which are not involved among random effects and matrix
    \code{z} includes covariates which are involved among random effects
    (and implicitely among fixed effects as well).
  }
  \item{random.intercept}{logical (vector) which determines for which responses random intercept
    should be included.
  }
  \item{prior.alpha}{a list which specifies prior distribution for fixed

  }
  \item{init.alpha}{a numeric vector with initial values of fixed effects
    (not the means of random effects) for the first chain. A sensible value is determined using the

    effects for the second chain.

  \item{scale.b}{a list specifying how to scale the random effects during

\section{Object of class GLMM_MCMClist}{
  Object of class \code{NMixMCMClist} is the list having two components
  of class \code{NMixMCMC} representing two parallel chains and
  additionally the following components:
  \describe{
  \item{PED}{values of penalized expected deviance and related
    quantities. It is a vector with five components: \code{D.expect} \eqn{=}
    estimated expected deviance, where the estimate is based on two
    parallel chains; \code{popt} \eqn{=} estimated penalty, where the
    estimate is based on simple MCMC average based on two parallel
    chains; \code{PED} \eqn{=} estimated penalized expected deviance
    \eqn{=} \code{D.expect} \eqn{+} \code{popt}; \code{wpopt} \eqn{=}
    estimated penalty, where the estimate is based on weighted MCMC average
    (through importance sampling) based on two parallel chains;
    \code{wPED} \eqn{=} estimated penalized expected deviance \eqn{=}
    \code{D.expect} \eqn{+} \code{wpopt}.}
  \item{D}{posterior mean of the deviance for each subject.}
  \item{popt}{contributions to the unweighted penalty from each subject.}
  \item{wpopt}{contributions to the weighted penalty from each subject.}
  \item{inv.D}{for each subject, number of iterations (in both chains), where the
    deviance was in fact equal to infinity (when the corresponding
    density was lower than \code{dens.zero}) and was not taken into account when
    computing \code{D.expect}.}
  \item{inv.popt}{for each subject, number of iterations, where the
    penalty was in fact equal to infinity and was not taken into account
    when computing \code{popt}.
  }
  \item{inv.wpopt}{for each subject, number of iterations, where the
    importance sampling weight was in fact equal to infinity and was not taken into account
    when computing \code{wpopt}.}

    weights.}
  \item{Deviance1}{sampled value of the observed data deviance from
    chain 1}

    chain 2}
  \item{Deviance_repl1_ch1}{sampled values of the deviance of data
    replicated according to the chain 1 evaluated under the parameters
    from chain 1}
  \item{Deviance_repl1_ch2}{sampled values of the deviance of data
    replicated according to the chain 1 evaluated under the parameters
    from chain 2}
  \item{Deviance_repl2_ch1}{sampled values of the deviance of data
    replicated according to the chain 2 evaluated under the parameters
    from chain 1}

    from chain 2}
